                    <h3>Find a suitable topic</h3>
                    <p>Finding a topic becomesa cruical task in writing poetries.Some
                        people find it as the most complicated work.Start writing on what is closest to your heart and
                        mind
                        at that moment, scribble a few lines-even if not poetic lines, try to play around with words and
                        say
                        the same thing again-and there you go, you might have just written the first lines of your
                        poetry.<br>
                        Observation: Observe the world around you with keen attention. Pay attention to the details,
                        emotions, and experiences that catch your eye. Explore different settings, nature, people, and
                        everyday objects. Write down your observations and use them as a starting point for your poetry.
                        <br>
                        Emotions and personal experiences: Tap into your own emotions and experiences. Reflect on your
                        memories, relationships, and life events. Consider the feelings associated with them, whether
                        joy,
                        sadness, love, or heartbreak. Use these emotions to express yourself through your poetry.
                        <br>
                        Reading and research: Read a wide range of poetry from different genres, styles, and time
                        periods.
                        Immerse yourself in the works of different poets to get a sense of their techniques, themes, and
                        wordplay. Additionally, research various topics, such as history, mythology, science, or
                        philosophy,
                        which can provide you with inspiration and new ideas.

                    <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
                    <p>Brainstorming is a method of generating ideas and sharing knowledge.People are able
                        to think more freely and they suggest as many spontaneous new ideas as possible.Let your brain
                        find you something INTERESTING!Brainstorming is a valuable tool for writing poetry as it helps
                        you
                        generate ideas, explore different perspectives, and discover unique ways to express your
                        thoughts and emotions. Here are some ways brainstorming can be useful for writing poetry:
                        <br>
                        Idea Generation: Brainstorming allows you to generate a wide range of ideas and concepts related
                        to your chosen theme or topic. By letting your thoughts flow freely without judgment, you can
                        uncover new connections, metaphors, and imagery that can be used in your poetry.
                        <br>
                        Overcoming Writer's Block: When you're stuck or experiencing writer's block, brainstorming can
                        help break through the creative barrier. By engaging in various brainstorming techniques, you
                        can stimulate your imagination, explore different angles, and find inspiration to jumpstart your
                        writing process.
                        <br>
                        Exploration of Emotions: Poetry often seeks to capture and convey emotions in a powerful and
                        evocative manner. Brainstorming allows you to delve into your own emotions and experiences,
                        enabling you to explore the depth and nuances of various feelings. Through brainstorming, you
                        can discover new ways to articulate and express those emotions effectively in your poetry.<br>

                    <h3>Pick A Poetic Form</h3>
                    <p> Poetic forms refer to the various structures and patterns that poems can take, often
                        characterized by specific rules or guidelines. These forms help shape the poem's structure,
                        rhythm, rhyme, and overall aesthetic. Here are some commonly known poetic forms:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sonnet: A 14-line poem that traditionally follows a specific rhyme scheme and meter. The two
                            most famous types of sonnets are the Shakespearean (abab cdcd efef gg) and the Petrarchan
                            (abbaabba cdecde or cdcdcd).</li>
                        <li>Haiku: A traditional Japanese form consisting of three lines with a 5-7-5 syllable count.
                            Haikus typically focus on nature, seasons, and moments of reflection.</li>
                        <li>Villanelle: A 19-line poem composed of five tercets (three-line stanzas) and a quatrain
                            (four-line stanza). The first and third lines of the opening tercet alternate as a refrain
                            throughout the poem.</li>
                        <li>Pantoum: A form that originated in Malaysia and consists of a series of quatrains with a
                            specific repeating pattern. The second and fourth lines of each stanza become the first and
                            third lines of the next stanza.</li>
                        <li>Sestina: A highly structured form with six stanzas of six lines each and a final triplet.
                            The same six end-words are repeated in a specific order throughout the poem.</li>
                        <li>Ghazal: A form rooted in Persian poetry, characterized by couplets that end with the same
                            rhyming word and include a refrain. Ghazals often explore themes of love, loss, and longing.
                        </li>
                        <li>Ode: A lyrical poem that pays homage to a specific subject or person. Odes often have a
                            formal structure, such as multiple stanzas with a consistent rhyme scheme.</li>
                        <li>Ballad: A narrative poem that tells a story, often with a steady rhythm and rhyme scheme.
                            Ballads are commonly associated with folk music and have a strong oral tradition.</li>
                        <li>Free Verse: A form that does not adhere to any specific rhyme scheme or meter. Free verse
                            allows for more flexibility and experimentation with line breaks, rhythms, and structures.
                        </li>
                        <li>Concrete Poetry: A visual form of poetry in which the arrangement of words on the page
                            creates a shape or image related to the poem's theme or content.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Rhyme Scheme</h3>
                    <p>In poetry, a rhyme scheme refers to the pattern of rhymes at the end of each line in a poem. It
                        is represented using letters to indicate the different rhyme sounds. Commonly used letters
                        include uppercase letters for the first rhyme sound and lowercase letters for subsequent sounds.

                        Here are some examples of common rhyme schemes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Couplet (AA):
                            A poem with a couplet rhyme scheme has two consecutive lines that rhyme with each other. For
                            example:
                            "I think that I shall never see (A)
                            A poem lovely as a tree (A)"</li>
                        <li> Alternate rhyme (ABAB):
                            This rhyme scheme consists of alternating rhymes between lines. For example:
                            "Whose woods these are I think I know (A)
                            His house is in the village though (B)
                            He will not see me stopping here (A)
                            To watch his woods fill up with snow (B)"</li>
                        <li> Ballad rhyme scheme (ABCB):
                            This rhyme scheme is often used in ballads, narrative poems that tell a story. The second
                            and fourth lines rhyme with each other, while the first and third lines do not rhyme. For
                            example:
                            "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, (A)
                            Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, (B)
                            While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, (C)
                            As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. (B)"
                        </li>
                        <li>Enclosed rhyme (ABBA):
                            In this rhyme scheme, the first and fourth lines rhyme with each other, and the second and
                            third lines rhyme with each other. For example:
                            "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? (A)
                            Thou art more lovely and more temperate: (B)
                            Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, (B)
                            And summer's lease hath all too short a date: (A)"</li>
                        <li>Sonnet rhyme scheme (ABABCDCDEFEFGG):
                            This rhyme scheme is commonly used in sonnets, particularly in the Shakespearean sonnet
                            form. It consists of three quatrains (four-line stanzas) and a final couplet. For example:
                            "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? (A)
                            Thou art more lovely and more temperate: (B)
                            Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, (A)
                            And summer's lease hath all too short a date: (B)
                            ..."</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Write Your Heart Out!</h3>
                    <p>A poem becomes a poem when written from the deepest layers of your
                        heart.Let your heart shpwer all your emotions into a piece of paper leading it to become a
                        beautiful
                        poetic verse.These lines that come from within will beautifully showcase the feelings you've
                        wrapped
                        wround all this while.Use of emotions becomes far more important that use of vocabulary.<br>
                        In the realm of poetry, the heart plays a vital role in expressing emotions, capturing moments,
                        and sharing profound thoughts. When a poet writes their heart out, they pour their innermost
                        feelings onto the page, allowing their words to become a vessel for their deepest thoughts and
                        experiences.
                        <br>
                        Writing from the heart means being authentic and sincere, baring one's soul without reservation.
                        It involves tapping into the wellspring of emotions within, whether they be joy, sorrow, love,
                        or pain, and transforming them into words that resonate with the reader's own humanity. It is a
                        vulnerable act, as the poet opens themselves up to the world, offering a glimpse into their
                        inner world and connecting on a deeply personal level.
                        <br>
                        When a poet writes their heart out, they delve into the depths of their imagination, allowing
                        their creativity to flow freely. They may draw inspiration from personal experiences, observing
                        the world around them, or even from dreams and fantasies. Their words become a canvas upon which
                        they paint vivid imagery, evoking sensations, and weaving narratives that transport readers to
                        different realms.
